# Security Fixes for LinkMaster

This document outlines the security improvements made to the LinkMaster application to ensure it meets Play Store requirements and follows best security practices.

## Network Security

### 1. Network Security Configuration

Added a proper network security configuration file at `app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml` that:
- Disables cleartext traffic by default
- Only allows cleartext traffic for specific domains that require it (localhost, etc.)
- Uses system certificate authorities for validation

### 2. Manifest Changes

Updated the AndroidManifest.xml to:
- Set `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"` to disable cleartext traffic globally
- Add `android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"` to use the new security configuration

## Credential Security

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Credentials

Removed hardcoded default passwords from the signing configuration in build.gradle.kts:
- Removed default values for `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, and `keyPassword`
- Added validation to ensure signing only proceeds when proper credentials are provided
- Added warning messages when credentials are missing

## Firebase Integration

### 1. Improved Firebase Configuration

- Updated the google-services.json.template with clear instructions
- Added detailed comments in build.gradle.kts about how to properly enable Firebase
- Ensured Firebase dependencies are properly commented out until explicitly enabled

## AdMob Integration

### 1. Added Proper AdMob Initialization

Created a proper AdMob integration with:
- `AdManager` class to handle AdMob initialization and ad loading
- `ConsentManager` class to handle user consent for personalized ads
- Proper initialization in the Application class
- Test device configuration for development builds

### 2. Added Consent Management

Implemented a consent management system that:
- Stores user consent preferences securely
- Initializes before AdMob to ensure compliance
- Provides methods to update and check consent status

## Other Security Improvements

### 1. Hidden API Access

- Removed Hidden API bypass code that could trigger Play Store policy violations
- Commented out Shizuku-related code that might cause security concerns

### 2. Permissions

- Ensured all sensitive permissions have proper maxSdkVersion limits where appropriate
- Added comments explaining the purpose of each permission

## Next Steps

The following items should be addressed in future updates:

1. Implement runtime permission requests with proper rationale for sensitive permissions
2. Add certificate pinning for critical API endpoints
3. Implement secure storage for sensitive user data
4. Add proper obfuscation rules in ProGuard configuration
5. Implement SafetyNet attestation for security-critical features
