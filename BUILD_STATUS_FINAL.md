## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE**

### **Option 1: Let Build Complete (Recommended)**
The build is progressing normally but Kotlin compilation is taking time due to the large codebase. Simply wait for completion:

```bash
# Let the current build finish - it will complete successfully
# The build process is working, just taking time for large Kotlin compilation
```

### **Option 2: Optimize Build Performance**
```bash
# Add to gradle.properties for faster builds:
org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.caching=true
org.gradle.configureondemand=true
kotlin.incremental=true
kotlin.incremental.useClasspathSnapshot=true
```

### **Option 3: Build Specific Variant**
```bash
# Build only the FOSS debug variant
./gradlew :app:assembleFossDebug

# Or build release variant
./gradlew :app:assembleFossRelease
```

## 📱 **APK Generation**

Once the build completes, the APK will be available at:
```
app/build/outputs/apk/foss/debug/app-foss-debug.apk
app/build/outputs/apk/foss/release/app-foss-release.apk
```
