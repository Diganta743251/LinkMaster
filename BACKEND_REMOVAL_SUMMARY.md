## Build Status
The app should now compile without backend dependencies. All network-related functionality has been stubbed out to prevent crashes while maintaining the core app functionality.

## AdMob Integration
AdMob remains as a placeholder as requested:
- ConsentManager and AdManager classes preserved
- Initialization code in LinkSheetApp maintained
- Ready for future ad implementation
